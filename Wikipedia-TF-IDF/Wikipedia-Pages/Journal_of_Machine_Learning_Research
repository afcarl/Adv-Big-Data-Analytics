The Journal of Machine Learning Research (usually abbreviated JMLR), is a scientific journal focusing on machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence. It was founded in 2000.

The journal was founded as an open-access alternative to the journal Machine Learning. In 2001, forty editors of Machine Learning resigned in order to support JMLR, saying that in the era of the internet, it was detrimental for researchers to continue publishing their papers in expensive journals with pay-access archives. Instead, they wrote, they supported the model of JMLR, in which authors retained copyright over their papers and archives were freely available on the internet.[1]

Print editions of JMLR were published by MIT Press until 2004, and by Microtome Publishing thereafter.

Since Summer 2007 JMLR is also publishing Machine Learning Open Source Software .
